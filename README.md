## 🔥 Information

I always liked minimalist and clean design, and when I saw Dona for the first time, I NEEDED something like this. Since I’m currently learning programming, I decided to create my own Dona (literally copying their design).

Please check them out: [Dona](https://dona.ai/).

Also wanted to learn Redux and dive more into UI construction.

This project was made with React ⚛️ and created with Vite ⚡️.

My initial intent was to transpose it to a mobile app using React Native, but, for now, it is only a web SPA.
